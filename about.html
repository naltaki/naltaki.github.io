          <p>Learn more about this project, particularly how itâ€™s built and
          who maintains it.</p>

          <h3 id="what-and-why">What and why</h3>

          <p>Naltaki is an experimental project made to offer a substitute to Meetup.com. It is using Parse.com as a back end and React & Primer on the front end side.</p>


          <h3 id="browser-support">Browser support</h3>

          <p>Naltaki currently supports Internet Explorer 10+ and the latest two
          versions of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox on OS X and Windows. While
          not a responsive or mobile-focused project, Mobile Safari and Chrome
          for Android should render just fine. Support for Linux-based browsers
          is not strictly guaranteed, but accounted for whenever possible.</p>

          <h3 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Our styles are built with LESS.</li>

            <li>ReactJS is used to create every UI components.</li>

            <li>Webpack is used to compile ES6/JSX to ES5 code which is supported by all modern browsers.</li>

            <li>GitHub pages is hosting the app.</li>

            <li>Parse.com is managing the back end.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 id="future-updates">Future updates</h3>

          <p>I don't have a current plan but I hope to continue improving it to the point of having a real decentralized alternative to Meetup.com but here is a list of good improvements:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Simple setup wizard that will fork the repository and create the Parse app for you</li>

            <li>Generated static website (better for SEO, faster render on the loading)</li>

            <li>Real admin interface (no need to go to Parse dashboard)</li>

            <li>Create an independant backend with Node.js & MySQL/PostgreSQL</li>

            <li>Improve the interface and makes it easier to customize it</li>

            <li>Members-only interface to see RSVP, private events, messages system</li>

            <li>Paid events, subscriptions</li>

            <li>Nice call of speakers interface instead of a Google Form</li>

            <li>Mobile app</li>
          </ul>

          My dream is to have a central hub system (which can be forked obviously) to gather events from other groups like what Technorati was doing with blogs (RIP...) to help fixing the discovery, curation of them which was the key of success of Meetup.com.
